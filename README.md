# hessian-regularizer-disentangle
This repository contains my original work on a novel Hessian regularizer for disentangling (HeRD) neural networks. This work was done as part of my master's thesis in Computer Science at Saarland University. 

This work contains two variants of HeRD:
1. universal HeRD that can be used for unsupervised disentanglement where the goal is to disentangle factors of variation in the data
2. class-specific HeRD that is aimed towards disentangling class-specific features
